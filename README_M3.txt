Given that we have gone from 5 members to 3 members, we have approached the project in a more 
collaborative manner.
 
Dylan- I worked on all the fake data generation. I also worked on getting the table and database 
design to work properly as well as getting the product page to appear for each product listed. 

Isabella - Together Christian and I worked on the product page, the cart page, and getting products 
selected to add to the cart. Individually, I worked on the seller page and got recent purchases to 
display. I also fixed some bugs we had such as getting our datetime stamps to be taken of the actual 
time and getting new purchase ids to be automatically generated.

Christian - Isabella and I worked on getting the opening page, products, and cart page working. I 
worked on displaying the buttons on the cart page that give the user the ability to continue shopping, 
checkout, or delete an item from the cart. If the user clicks checkout, I made it so that this product 
shows up in purchases. 

Code for creating and populating our larger database can be found in db/generated/gen.py or the gen.py 
file in the generated folder that is in the db folder.
