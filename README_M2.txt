Team Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve Milestone 2

seeting if branching works



Dylan Paul: Users Guru
	- I worked on the accounts/purchases mock front-end design as well as worked on creating the user table and helped with the product table. Additionally, together I worked with my teammates on creating a table design that works well with all functionality needed.
Alex Medow: Products Guru
	- I helped divide up the tables, assign keys, and set initial constraints. I also worked with my teammates to plan out the pages of the website. While we worked collaboratively, I paid attention to the products.

Thomas Colicchio: Carts Guru
	- We worked as a team to conceptualize our database design. I worked specifically laying out the structure of the cart and additional "save for later cart" design for both the database and the website. I also added the "coupon" table. I then added and populated CSV data files, which were copied into load.sql.

Isabella Geraci: Sellers Guru
	- As a team we designed the website pages deciding what would be on each web page, including what data would appear and what how buttons would function. I specifically focused on the "Inventory" and "Browse Sales" web pages as I am responsible for the Inventory/Order Fulfillment section. I also helped create the database design and I translated our design into create statements to form the database.

Christian Garvin: Social Guru
	- I wrote page descriptions for product_reviews and seller_reviews. I also wrote database design for those tables. Finally, I wrote the product_reviews, seller_reviews, and car CREATE statements.
